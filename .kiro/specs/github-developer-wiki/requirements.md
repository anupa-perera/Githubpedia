# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Wikipedia-like system for developers that allows them to explore and understand GitHub repositories through intelligent querying. The system leverages GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) with LangChain orchestration to provide contextual answers about codebases, supporting both authenticated access for private repositories and anonymous exploration of public repositories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Repository Access and Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate with GitHub to access any repository, so that I can explore both public and private repositories with optimal performance and full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL require GitHub authentication before accessing any repository features
2. WHEN a user completes GitHub OAuth THEN the system SHALL securely store their access token and display their profile information
3. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display their accessible repositories and provide URL input for any GitHub repository
4. WHEN a user provides a repository URL THEN the system SHALL validate the format and load the repository using their authenticated GitHub MCP context
5. IF authentication fails or expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to re-authentication and preserve the user's intended repository selection

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Query Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ask natural language questions about any repository and receive intelligent responses, so that I can quickly understand codebases without manual exploration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL use a configured LLM (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, or local model) to process the query
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the LLM SHALL work with LangChain to intelligently determine which GitHub MCP tools to use
3. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL include relevant code snippets, file references, and architectural insights
4. WHEN discussing code patterns THEN the system SHALL search across the repository and provide ranked, contextual results
5. IF a query requires data not available THEN the system SHALL explain limitations and suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 2.1: User-Provided LLM Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide my own AI service API key from multiple providers, so that I have full control over my usage, costs, and can choose the best model for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes GitHub authentication THEN the system SHALL prompt them to configure their preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenRouter)
2. WHEN a user selects OpenRouter THEN the system SHALL display available models and allow model selection from the OpenRouter catalog
3. WHEN a user provides their API key THEN the system SHALL validate the key and securely encrypt and store it in their session
4. WHEN a user makes queries THEN the system SHALL use their personal API key and selected model for LLM processing
5. IF a user hasn't configured an LLM provider THEN the system SHALL block query functionality and provide setup instructions with links to provider registration

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Repository Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide deep insights about repository architecture, dependencies, and implementation patterns, so that I can quickly assess and understand complex codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a repository THEN the system SHALL automatically identify programming languages, frameworks, and key dependencies
2. WHEN asked about architecture THEN the system SHALL analyze folder structure, design patterns, and component relationships
3. WHEN queried about specific implementations THEN the system SHALL locate and explain relevant code sections with context
4. WHEN exploring large repositories THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent summaries and navigation guidance
5. IF analysis is incomplete due to size constraints THEN the system SHALL prioritize most relevant sections and inform the user

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want clear feedback and graceful error handling, so that I understand system limitations and can take appropriate actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display wait times and provide retry options (authentication ensures higher limits)
2. WHEN network or service errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with retry options
3. WHEN repositories are inaccessible due to permissions THEN the system SHALL explain the specific access limitations
4. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
5. IF critical services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform users of limitations
