# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Wikipedia-like system for developers that allows them to explore and understand GitHub repositories through intelligent querying. The system will use GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) to access repository data and provide contextual answers about codebases, making it easier for developers to understand unfamiliar projects, contribute to open source, or research implementation patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input a GitHub repository URL and ask questions about its codebase, so that I can quickly understand the project structure and implementation details without manually browsing through files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and repository accessibility
2. WHEN a valid repository is provided THEN the system SHALL use GitHub MCP to fetch repository metadata and structure
3. WHEN a user asks a question about the repository THEN the system SHALL provide contextual answers based on the codebase analysis
4. IF the repository is private or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for specific code patterns or implementations within a repository, so that I can find relevant examples and understand how certain features are implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for code patterns THEN the system SHALL use GitHub MCP search capabilities to find matching code snippets
2. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL display code snippets with file paths and line numbers
3. WHEN multiple matches exist THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and provide pagination
4. IF no matches are found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative search terms or broader queries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the architecture and dependencies of a repository, so that I can assess the project's complexity and technology stack before contributing or using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify and display the main programming languages used
2. WHEN dependency analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL parse package files and display key dependencies
3. WHEN architecture questions are asked THEN the system SHALL analyze folder structure and provide architectural insights
4. WHEN technology stack information is requested THEN the system SHALL identify frameworks, libraries, and tools used
